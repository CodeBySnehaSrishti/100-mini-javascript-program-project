This project demonstrates a simple Dark and Light Mode Toggle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a responsive navbar with a custom toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark themes smoothly.

The toggle works by adding and removing a dark-mode class on the body, which updates background colors and UI elements dynamically.
Pure CSS is used to design the toggle button, while JavaScript handles the theme switching logic.

This beginner-friendly project helps in understanding DOM manipulation, CSS pseudo-elements, and theme toggling, making it ideal for practice and portfolio use.
